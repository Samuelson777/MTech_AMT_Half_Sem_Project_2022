## Motivation
The motivation behind this research is to develop a sustainable method for synthesizing aluminium metal matrix composites using recycled materials, thereby contributing to environmental conservation while improving material performance.

## Objectives
- To synthesize aluminium metal matrix composites using AA5083(O) as the matrix material.
- To evaluate the mechanical and tribological properties of the developed composites.

## Materials and Methods
- **Matrix Material**: Aluminium Alloy AA5083(O)
- **Reinforcement**: Recycled fuse carrier ceramic particulates (4 wt%, 8 wt%, and 12 wt%)
- **Fabrication Method**: Stir casting process
- **Mechanical Tests**: 
  - Ultimate tensile strength
  - Hardness
  - Wear characteristics

### Experimental Procedure
1. **Material Selection**: AA5083(O) was chosen for its excellent welding characteristics and corrosion resistance.
2. **Reinforcement Preparation**: Recycled ceramic particulates were preheated and mixed with molten aluminium.
3. **Stir Casting**: The mixture was stirred to ensure uniform distribution of the reinforcement before being poured into molds.
4. **Testing**: The mechanical properties were evaluated using standardized testing methods.
